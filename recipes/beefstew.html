      <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
      <li>2 ½ pounds stew meat</li>
      <li>3-6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons cold butter</li>
      <li>2 cups yellow onion</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 cup high-quality cabernet sauvignon</li>
      <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>2 tsp better than bouillon</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>5 medium carrots</li>
      <li>1 lb. baby Yukon gold potatoes</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 large branch rosemary</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Cold Water + 3 tablespoons Corn Starch</li>
      <li>2-3 drops Kitchen Bouquet Browning + Seasoning Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut meat into 1-inch cubes, discard any large pieces of fat. Fat
        marbleized into the meat is fine!
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle beef with black pepper, garlic salt, and celery salt. Toss to
        coat. Sprinkle flour over the meat and toss again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 3 Tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.
        Add the meat in batches, don’t overcrowd the pan). Brown on each side
        for 45 seconds. Add more oil if needed. Transfer to slow cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium and melt 1 Tablespoon butter. Add onions and cook
        for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Use a silicone spatula
        to clean the bottom of the pan, removing any brown remnants. This will
        give the soup lots of good flavor. If necessary, add a splash of wine to
        help loosen it. Transfer the onions/garlic mixture to the slow cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add all remaining ingredients <strong>except</strong> for the peas, corn
        starch mixture, and 2 tablespoons of cold butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook on low for 7 ½ to 8 hours or high for 3½ to 4 hours, until the
        vegetables are softened and the potatoes are fork tender.
      </li>
      <li>Add the peas during the last 15 minutes of cooking.</li>
      <li>
        Optional: To thicken, combine ¼ cup COLD water with 3 Tablespoons of
        cornstarch. Slowly add it to the stew, stirring to incorporate. It will
        continue to thicken upon standing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat. Remove the bay leaves and rosemary stem. Swirl in 2
        tablespoons of cold butter for a smooth, velvety finish. This is a
        technique that chefs use called “Monter au Beurre”.
      </li>
      <li>Add 3 drops of Kitchen Bouquet for an even darker color.</li>
    </ol>
