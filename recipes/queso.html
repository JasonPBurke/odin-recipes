    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A big bowl of gold</p>
    <p>
      If you're a University of Oklahoma alumnus you've probably sat down at The
      Mont for a drink and a generous helping of the restaurant's famous
      four-cheese queso dip. The restaurant is currently owned by three alumni
      and the dip (which inspired this recipe) is loaded with pico de gallo and
      chunks of browned sausage. It's the perfect snack for tip-off or
      half-time.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One 1-pound package refrigerated hot breakfast sausage</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>One 2-pound block deli American cheese</li>
      <li>One 10-ounce can diced tomatoes and green chiles</li>
      <li>2 cans chopped green chiles</li>
      <li>1 jalapeno, diced</li>
      <li>Chips, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brown the sausage and onion in a large nonstick skillet, breaking the
        sausage up as you go. Once browned, drain off some of the fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop the cheese block into cubes and add along with the diced tomatoes
        and green chiles and chopped green chiles, juice and all.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook over a low heat until it all starts coming together. Then stir in
        the diced jalapeno.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with chips.</li>
    </ol>
